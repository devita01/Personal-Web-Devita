                    I am a 4th semester student majoring in computer science who has a career interest in technology. Since high school I have really liked TIK subjects, because these subjects discuss about computers, and in high school I was given a project to create a website using HTML. Even though HTML is not a programming language, however this project is what made me finally choose to study computer science at Binus, because I was very interested in creating website projects like that, and wanted to know more tools for creating websites.

                    At the beginning of college I really found it difficult to major in computer science, I felt that this learning was not what I wanted. But I feel I should be able to finish what I have started. Until finally in the second semester there were courses such as Data Structures, Human Computer Interaction, and Calculus which really attracted my interest in this computer science major again. I really like mathematics, such as Calculus, because I think studying mathematics will hone our thinking / logic skills, and we will know how to solve problems. From the Data Structure & Human Computer Interaction course, I learned how to create programs, the logic that must be created in the program, learned programming languages, and finally produced the website we wanted.
