                <div class="project-description">
                    <p>In this project, I developed a prototype mental health counseling application, this application is similar to Halodoc. The prototype of this application was designed using figma, in this prototype there are various features, such as choosing a psychologist or psychiatrist, searching for a doctor's name, chatting with a doctor, and also a payment feature. During the creation of this project, I learned various aspects and tools in Figma. I use the YouTube application to learn and explore various uses of tools in Figma. This includes how to make the password hidden and unhidden in the login form, and also how to ensure the screen can be scrolled up and down smoothly.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Because this is the first project given during UTS, I put a lot of effort into this project, this is also because I have never used figma before, so I tried as much as possible to explore the tools in figma, in order to get maximum results. Learning many tools in Figma from YouTube not only helped me complete this project, but also made me very interested in using the various tools in Figma.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This experience has given me in-depth knowledge of app prototype design, especially using Figma, and enhanced my skills in UI/UX design. This project also enabled me to carry out independent learning and exploration to overcome technical challenges, and strengthened my interest in application design and development.</p>
