                    <p>In this research, my friends and I conducted research to detect comments or tweets containing hate speech using machine learning algorithms, namely SVM (Support Vector Machine) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors). We also explored dataset balancing techniques to ensure the model can work effectively in detecting hate speech. This is important because an unbalanced dataset will make the model less accurate due to lack of data to train the model. To overcome the problem of dataset imbalance, we apply random over sampling technique. We coded using the Python programming language in Google Colab to determine which algorithm was more accurate in detecting hate speech.</p>

                    <p>This project gave me a better insight into the process of writing a thesis, from doing research to writing the paper. I began to understand the importance of conducting in-depth research before writing something in a paper, because any information written must be based on facts and strong evidence. Apart from that, I also learned more deeply about the Python programming language and its application in building machine learning models.</p>
