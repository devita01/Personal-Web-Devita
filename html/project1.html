                    <p>Developing this coffee shop website project has been an invaluable experience for me. This project includes several important elements such as a navbar consisting of several pages : Home Page, which contains a brief introduction about this website; About Us Page, which explains in detail the concept and vision of the coffee shop that I created; Our Product Page, which displays various kinds of coffee and other drinks that we sell; Our Store Page, which tells the location of our coffee shop outlets and Membership Page, which allows users to register and purchase our products after completing the registration process.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages ​​in creating this website. I also ensured that the website is responsive, so that its appearance can adapt to various devices, whether mobile or desktop screens.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also developed this website by considering UI & UX, starting from choosing attractive colors, ease of use for each feature, and an adaptive appearance. The biggest challenge I faced was making the website truly responsive, because I had to adjust and test its appearance repeatedly until I got optimal results. Through this project, I not only honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but also deepened my understanding of how to design responsive and user-friendly websites. This experience greatly enriched my insight and improved my skills in web development.</p>
