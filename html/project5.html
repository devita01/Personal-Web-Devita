                    <p>I developed this project with my friends, we developed an e-commerce platform project for buying and selling seafood such as fish, crabs, shrimp, and others. Our main goal is to expand the target market for fishermen and help increase their income. Currently, many people still buy seafood directly at the market. With this e-commerce platform, we help fishermen to sell seafood directly to consumers or as first sellers without intermediaries. This e-commerce platform also helps people who don't have time to go to the market and prefer to shop online. In this project, I act as a full stack developer, we use React.js for frontend development, Node.js for backend, and MongoDB as the database.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This project enriched my knowledge in various aspects of web development. I learned how to develop responsive and interactive user interfaces with React.js, learned how to build efficient backends with Node.js, and managed data effectively with MongoDB. Apart from that, I also gained valuable insight into effective methods for completing projects as a group to achieve common goals.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This project not only improved my technical skills, but also strengthened my ability to work collaboratively in a team. I am proud to be able to contribute to helping local fishermen to increase their income through technology. This experience motivates me to continue learning and developing in the field of web development and e-commerce technology.</p>
