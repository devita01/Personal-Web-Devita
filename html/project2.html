                    <p>The Guarjian website is a website for selling cosmetics, skincare, medicines, vitamins and hair care products. This website was inspired by the Guardian website, but the website I created only focuses on the frontend. It has several pages, namely : Home Page which contains a brief explanation of the purpose of this website; Promotion Page, which function to inform about products that are on sale ; Product Page, which displays all products sold on this website; About Us, which provides detailed information about Guarjian stores; and Contact Us which contains a registration form for users who want to ask for further information about the product and must create an account first. I developed this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Different from the previous project which was done with a group of friends, this project is my personal assignment. The main challenge I faced when working on this project was ensuring that the website design was responsive, so that its appearance could adapt to various devices, both mobile and desktop screens. Apart from that, another difficulty is managing this project's deadline which is close to the previous project's deadline. I had to work hard so that both projects could be completed on time without reducing the quality of the results.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Despite these challenges, I managed to complete this website well, producing a functional and attractive appearance. This project not only improved my skills in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but also deepened my understanding of how to create responsive, user-friendly web designs within tight time constraints. This experience greatly contributed to my development as a web developer and improved my ability to manage time effectively.</p>
