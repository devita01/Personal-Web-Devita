                    <p>This project was developed with ASP.NET framework, with C# as the main programming language. The development process follows Domain Driven Design principles. It integrates key components such as View, Controllers, Handlers, Repositories, Factories, and Models. This project includes three distinct roles that users can access : Admin, Customer, and Guest.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This project is not required to focus on the user interface (UI). But the challenge is that there are several criteria that must be adhered to, in order to get a perfect score. This project is carried out in groups, which definitely requires good time management, in order to collaborate optimally, and ensure all requirements are met.</p>
